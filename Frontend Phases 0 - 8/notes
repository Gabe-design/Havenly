/* Behind the Scenes of Redux (with async stuff like thunks):
User interacts â†’ triggers an action
That action (like fetchData()) dispatches a request to the backend
Backend processes it and sends back a response
That response is then used to dispatch another action like receiveData(data)
Redux updates the store
React sees the store changed and re-renders */

finished frontend auth me!

If you ever need to update/redeploy your frontend, just follow these steps:

1. Make your changes to the files in the __frontend__ directory.
2. Run `npm run build` to refresh the build files in the __frontend/dist__
   directory with your changes.
3. Commit all changes to the `main` branch.
4. Push to GitHub.
5. Go to your site and confirm that the changes have been auto-deployed. (This
   last step might take a few minutes to manifest.)
