/* Behind the Scenes of Redux (with async stuff like thunks):
User interacts â†’ triggers an action
That action (like fetchData()) dispatches a request to the backend
Backend processes it and sends back a response
That response is then used to dispatch another action like receiveData(data)
Redux updates the store
React sees the store changed and re-renders */
